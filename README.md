# Excel_Project
In this Project , First I downloaded the data from Kaggle. This Data is from a Supermarket Store.

Next , I cleaned the data . Then I created some new columns for Analysis using Excel formulas.

Then I created Pivot Tables and also created relevant Pivot Charts.

Finally I created a Dashboard and I also inserted Slicers to make the Dashboard Interactive.
